# Architecture Decision Records

This section documents the key architectural decisions made in the Arfa project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title** - Short descriptive name
2. **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context** - What problem are we solving?
4. **Decision** - What did we decide?
5. **Consequences** - What are the tradeoffs?
