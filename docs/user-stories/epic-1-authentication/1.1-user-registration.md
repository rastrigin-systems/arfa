# Story 1.1: User Registration (New Organization)

**As a** new user
**I want to** create an account with my organization details
**So that** I can start managing AI agents for my company

**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
**UI:** `/signup`

## Acceptance Criteria


```gherkin
Given I am on the signup page
When I enter my full name, email, organization name, organization slug, and password
And I click "Create Account"
Then a new organization is created with me as the owner
And I am redirected to the dashboard
And I receive a session token

Given I am typing an organization slug
When I enter a slug that already exists (e.g., "acme")
Then I see "This slug is already taken" appear in real-time (500ms debounce)
And the slug input shows a red error state
And a red X icon appears next to the input

Given I am typing an organization slug
When I enter a unique slug (e.g., "my-company-2025")
Then I see "✓" appear indicating the slug is available
And the slug input shows a green success state

Given I try to submit the form with an invalid password
When I click "Create Account" with a password missing uppercase/number/special char
Then I see inline validation errors for password requirements
And the form does not submit
```
