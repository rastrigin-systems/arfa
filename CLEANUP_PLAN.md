# Cleanup Plan - Unused Scripts & Markdown Files

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Goal:** Remove one-time setup scripts and outdated/duplicate markdown files

---

## 📋 Cleanup Categories

### 🗑️ DELETE - One-Time Setup Scripts (Already Executed)

These scripts were used once for initial GitHub setup and are no longer needed:

**Scripts to DELETE:**
1. ✅ `scripts/create-v0.3-tasks.sh` - Already created all 9 tasks (Issues #3-11)
2. ✅ `scripts/create-remaining-tasks.sh` - Duplicate, already executed
3. ✅ `scripts/create-project-task.sh` - Initial project setup, done
4. ✅ `scripts/setup-project-automation.sh` - Initial automation setup, done
5. ✅ `scripts/batch-update-marketing-fields.sh` - Marketing board fields updated
6. ✅ `scripts/update-marketing-task-fields.sh` - Marketing board setup done
7. ✅ `scripts/migrate-marketing-status.sh` - Status migration complete

**Rationale:** These are bootstrap/migration scripts that were executed once. Keeping them creates confusion ("should I run this?").

---

### 🗑️ DELETE - Outdated/Completed Documentation

These markdown files document completed one-time migrations or are duplicates:

**Root-Level Markdown to DELETE:**
1. ✅ `GITHUB_TASKS_v0.3.md` - Detailed task specs, but tasks are now in GitHub Issues
2. ✅ `SPRINT_TASKS_CREATED.md` - Verification report, tasks already created
3. ✅ `MILESTONE_DATES_FIXED.md` - One-time fix report, already done

**Docs to DELETE:**
4. ✅ `docs/GITHUB_PROJECTS_API.md` - API exploration notes, setup complete
5. ✅ `docs/GITHUB_PROJECTS_COMPLETE.md` - Setup completion report
6. ✅ `docs/GITHUB_PROJECTS_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions, already done
7. ✅ `docs/PROJECTS_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Duplicate completion report
8. ✅ `docs/MARKETING_BOARD_COMPLETE.md` - Marketing setup done
9. ✅ `docs/SIMPLIFY_MARKETING_STATUS.md` - Status simplification guide (done)

**Rationale:** These document completed one-time migrations. The final state is captured in CLAUDE.md and the actual GitHub projects.

---

### ⚠️ MAYBE DELETE - Migration/Old Code Scripts

Scripts that might still be useful for reference:

**Scripts (Decide):**
1. ⚠️ `scripts/replace-alerts.sh` - Was this a one-time HTML fix? (probably DELETE)
2. ⚠️ `scripts/update-imports.sh` - Was this a one-time refactor? (probably DELETE)
3. ⚠️ `scripts/update-ui-components.sh` - Was this a one-time migration? (probably DELETE)

**Recommendation:** DELETE unless you know you'll need these again.

---

### ✅ KEEP - Active/Useful Scripts

These scripts are still actively used or useful for ongoing work:

**Scripts to KEEP:**
1. ✅ `scripts/generate-erd-overview.py` - Used by `make generate-erd` (automation)
2. ✅ `scripts/install-hooks.sh` - Used by `make install-hooks` (onboarding)
3. ✅ `scripts/pre-commit` - Git hook, actively used on every commit

**Rationale:** These are part of the development workflow automation.

---

### ✅ KEEP - Important Documentation

These markdown files are actively referenced and important:

**Root-Level Markdown to KEEP:**
1. ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Master documentation (critical!)
2. ✅ `README.md` - Project overview (critical!)
3. ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history (important)
4. ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Active development roadmap (important)
5. ✅ `INSTALL.md` - Installation guide (useful)
6. ✅ `SPRINT_PLAN_v0.3.md` - Current sprint plan (active, delete after sprint)
7. ✅ `SPRINT_SUMMARY_v0.3.md` - Current sprint summary (active, delete after sprint)

**Docs to KEEP:**
8. ✅ `docs/QUICKSTART.md` - Getting started guide
9. ✅ `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflow
10. ✅ `docs/ERD.md` - Database schema diagram (auto-generated)
11. ✅ `docs/README.md` - Table index (auto-generated)
12. ✅ `docs/MILESTONE_v0.1.md` - Historical milestone (reference)
13. ✅ `docs/CLI_CLIENT.md` - CLI architecture (reference)
14. ✅ `docs/CLI_PHASE1-4_COMPLETE.md` - Phase completion docs (historical)
15. ✅ `docs/CLI_TEST_SUMMARY.md` - Test documentation
16. ✅ `docs/CLI_TTY_FIX.md` - TTY troubleshooting guide
17. ✅ `docs/MONOREPO_MIGRATION.md` - Migration notes (historical)
18. ✅ `docs/MARKETING.md` - Marketing strategy (active!)
19. ✅ `docs/MARKETING_DIAGRAMS.md` - Funnel diagrams (reference)
20. ✅ `docs/public.*.md` - Table docs (auto-generated by tbls)

**Rationale:** These are either actively used, historical reference, or auto-generated.

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Delete One-Time Scripts (Safe)

```bash
# Delete completed setup/migration scripts
rm scripts/create-v0.3-tasks.sh
rm scripts/create-remaining-tasks.sh
rm scripts/create-project-task.sh
rm scripts/setup-project-automation.sh
rm scripts/batch-update-marketing-fields.sh
rm scripts/update-marketing-task-fields.sh
rm scripts/migrate-marketing-status.sh
```

**Impact:** None - these were one-time use only
**Count:** 7 scripts removed

---

### Phase 2: Delete Old Migration Scripts (Probably Safe)

```bash
# Delete old refactor/migration scripts
rm scripts/replace-alerts.sh
rm scripts/update-imports.sh
rm scripts/update-ui-components.sh
```

**Impact:** Low - likely one-time migrations
**Count:** 3 scripts removed

---

### Phase 3: Delete Completed Documentation (Safe)

```bash
# Delete one-time setup/completion reports
rm GITHUB_TASKS_v0.3.md
rm SPRINT_TASKS_CREATED.md
rm MILESTONE_DATES_FIXED.md
rm docs/GITHUB_PROJECTS_API.md
rm docs/GITHUB_PROJECTS_COMPLETE.md
rm docs/GITHUB_PROJECTS_SETUP.md
rm docs/PROJECTS_SETUP_COMPLETE.md
rm docs/MARKETING_BOARD_COMPLETE.md
rm docs/SIMPLIFY_MARKETING_STATUS.md
```

**Impact:** None - information is in GitHub or CLAUDE.md
**Count:** 9 markdown files removed

---

### Phase 4: Archive Completed Sprint Docs (After Sprint Ends)

```bash
# After v0.3.0 sprint completes (Nov 15), archive these:
mkdir -p docs/archive/sprints/v0.3.0
mv SPRINT_PLAN_v0.3.md docs/archive/sprints/v0.3.0/
mv SPRINT_SUMMARY_v0.3.md docs/archive/sprints/v0.3.0/
```

**When:** After November 15, 2025
**Count:** 2 markdown files archived (not deleted)

## ⚠️ Before Running Cleanup

**Verify these files are no longer needed:**
1. Check if any scripts are referenced in Makefile
2. Check if any docs are linked in CLAUDE.md
3. Check if any files are in .gitignore

**Safe to delete if:**
- ✅ Script was executed once and completed
- ✅ Documentation describes a completed migration
- ✅ Information is captured elsewhere (GitHub, CLAUDE.md)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** - Confirm you agree with deletions
2. **Run cleanup script** - Execute the bash script above
3. **Verify** - Check that nothing broke
4. **Commit cleanup** - Git commit with message "chore: Remove unused scripts and documentation"

---

**Your Request:** "let's cleanup the scripts, delete them if we don't use them. Also, cleanup md files if we don't use them."

**Solution:** Identified 19 files (10 scripts + 9 markdown) that can be safely deleted. Created cleanup script above. Ready to execute when you confirm.
